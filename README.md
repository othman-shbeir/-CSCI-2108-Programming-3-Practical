## üß© Repository Structure

Below is an overview of the main projects included in this repository:

### 1. **First Step Project**

A simple introductory project demonstrating **JavaFX inline code** for building graphical user interfaces. This is the first example of how to create a UI directly from Java code without external FXML files.

### 2. **FruitsStore**

An **advanced JavaFX application** built using **Scene Builder**. This project simulates a fruit store and demonstrates UI structuring, event handling, and scene transitions for professional desktop applications.

### 3. **JavaStreams**

A comprehensive **case study on Java Streams**, showcasing how to efficiently process collections, perform filtering, mapping, and aggregation operations using the Stream API.

### 4. **DatabaseCaseStudy1**

A **MySQL database integration** case study using **Java JDBC**. It follows the **Repository Design Pattern**, demonstrating clean separation between database operations and business logic.

### 5. **JPA_CaseStudy**

A **Java Persistence API (JPA)** case study that illustrates how to interact with relational databases through object-relational mapping (ORM), focusing on entities, relationships, and queries.

### 6. **MultiThreadingCaseStudy**

An applied project exploring **multithreading in Java**, including the use of the `Thread` class, `Runnable`, and `ExecutorService`. It explains how to manage concurrent tasks and optimize performance.

### 7. **JavaFX_Background_Tasks_and_Services_Case_Study**

A focused case study on **JavaFX concurrency**, highlighting the use of the **Task** and **Service** classes to handle background operations without freezing the UI.

### 8. **clubs_Service**

A **Spring Boot microservice** implementing the backend for a Clubs Management System. This project introduces modern backend development using **Spring Boot**, **REST APIs**, and layered architecture.
